# The code is a little messy

### Why is the package `com.example.weathermaster`?

- Well, when I made this, I didnâ€™t know a whole lot about Android development, and I didnâ€™t realize you had to change the package name. So I made it with com.example, and now I canâ€™t really change it because that would make it a whole new app. People who installed it from F-Droid may not get updates. I might change the package name if I publish the app on the Google Play Store.

### Why is it made with JS?

- I was more familiar with it, and it works much smoother and is easier to maintain. Even without optimization, it still runs like butter. But I do have plans to convert it to Kotlin, though it's likely to happen. ðŸ«
